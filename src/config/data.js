      "These loaded BBQ baked potatoes are filled with a creamy garlic herb spinach and potato mixture and then loaded with BBQ chicken, caramelized little pan roasted mushrooms, bleu cheese crumbles, crispy onions, and chives. Ho-lee-smokes. Crunchy. Saucy. Creamy, tangy, sweet. So filling. The flavors, the textures… if a minimalist baked potato is your dream, you may have to look elsewhere.

There are the party people who flock to the state for music festivals and wild binges; there are the foodies who treat Goa like their personal chef, demanding wider varieties and better quality food every time they visit, and then there are the beach bums, who want nothing more than to lounge on the sand and vegetate. These groups come in droves, take over the hotels, get comfortable at the beaches, and zip around the narrow lanes in their rented cars. We can hide behind the claim that Goa needs tourists to survive, but have we ever thought about how the locals feel about this 'invasion?'  To educate myself, I approached my friend Chryselle, who moved to Panjim with her husband and son. Chryselle lives in the Old Post Office building in Fontainhas.",
